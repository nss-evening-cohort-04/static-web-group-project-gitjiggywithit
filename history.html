    <h1 class="post-title">About Us</h1>
        <p>The National Association of Printing Ink Manufacturers (NAPIM) has been the only national trade association for the printing ink industry since it's founding in 1916. The overall purpose is to promote the general development and improvement of member companies by fostering greater understanding and knowledge of the printing ink industry as well as representing the industry as a whole on a national basis. In addition, NAPIM provides seminars, conferences, publications, bulletins and consultation services to its member companies on an ongoing basis. The association exists in order to serve its membership, which is accomplished by being both re-active and pro-active on key issues affecting the ink industry. NAPIM members include ink manufacturers, companies that supply raw materials and manufacturers of instrumentation and equipment utilized by the printing ink industry.</p>

  <h1>History of Ink and It's Development</h1>
  <p>Its greatest impact was to spread knowledge, in the form of the printed word, long before Johann Gutenberg invented the printing press in Germany in the mid fifteenth Century. Ink has been a dye since the dawn of man; early examples were a mixture of soot from wood smoke and animal fat, thickened with the gelatine from skins.

Ink is everywhere, its used to print the labels of the food in the supermarket, newspapers, advertising, regular and ballpoint pens.</p></div></div>

    <h1 class="post-title3">History of Ink, Inc.</h1>
    <p>The ancient Egyptians and the Chinese, both developed ink at approximately the same time around 2500. B.C. They used fine particles of carbon called lampblack for the colorant, and gums, saps or glues were the vehicles.

Despite the fact that ancient inks were crude efforts the ancients strove to make them enduring, so that the information they passed on remained a permanent record. The ancient Hebrew word for ink is “deyo”, which when translated means blackness.

Ink and its production has always been to a certain extent problematic, it has always had issues regarding durability, it fades when exposed to sunlight and different types of paper absorb different amounts of ink.

Between the eighth and the eleventh Century a chemical ink, iron gall ink developed from tannic acid and iron salt became a popular colorant bound by resin. To understand the chemical structure of ink it is necessary to understand the properties of the chemicals that have gone into ink production and why certain chemicals improve or debase its durability.</p></div></div>
